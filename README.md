# Data Structures - Implemented in C
\
If you are new to TI BASIC, and want to edit/get a look at the programs with your computer, I highly recommend https://www.cemetech.net/sc/.  It is a free IDE for TI BASIC.  Simply load a program from this repository into the IDE, and it will display a nicely formatted version of the code that you can read, edit, and even emulate.

# Structures so far
Dynamic Array - dynamicArray.c\
Queue - two different implementations\
    - with a linked list - linked.c\
    - with a circular array - circular.c\

There are many more to be added in the coming weeks!
